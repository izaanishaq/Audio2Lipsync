# Audio2LipSync

## How to Use

### 1. Upload Your Files

**Voiceover Audio:**
- Click "Upload Voiceover" or drag an audio file (MP3, WAV, etc.)
- The tool will analyze the audio volume levels

**Mouth Shape Images:**
- Prepare SVG images of the 14 required phoneme mouth shapes
- Name them exactly as: `Neutral.svg`, `M.svg`, `S.svg`, `D.svg`, `Ee.svg`, `Aa.svg`, `Uh.svg`, `Oh.svg`, `R.svg`, `W-Oo.svg`, `F.svg`, `L.svg`, `Smile.svg`, `Surprised.svg`
- **Option 1**: Load from saved library (if you've used this phoneme set before)
- **Option 2**: Upload new SVG files and save them to library for future use
- The app will automatically validate and categorize your phoneme shapes

### 2. Configure Settings

**Frame Rate (FPS):**
- Choose from 12, 24, 30, or 60 FPS
- 24 FPS is standard for most animations

**Audio Sensitivity:**
- Adjust how responsive the mouth movements are to audio volume
- Higher values = more dramatic mouth movements
- Range: 0.1 to 2.0

**Animation Smoothing:**
- Reduces jittery movements between frames
- Higher values = smoother but less responsive animation
- Range: 0 to 10

**Expression Mapping:**
- **Phoneme-based (Recommended)**: Uses advanced audio analysis for standardized phoneme mouth shapes
- **Volume-based (Legacy)**: Simple volume-to-openness mapping for traditional sequences

### 3. Using the Lips Library System

**Save Your Mouth Shapes:**
1. Upload your mouth shape images
2. Click "Save Current Set" 
3. Give your library a descriptive name (e.g., "Character_Expressions", "Smirk_Set")
4. Your mouth shapes are now saved for future projects!

**Load Saved Libraries:**
1. Use the "Saved Libraries" dropdown
2. Select a previously saved mouth shape set
3. Images load instantly - no need to re-upload!

**Manage Libraries:**

### Mouth Shape Images

#### Required Phoneme Shapes (14 total)

The application requires exactly 14 standardized phoneme mouth shapes. Each shape corresponds to specific speech sounds:

| **Shape Name** | **Phonemes/Sounds** | **Description** | **Example Words** |
|----------------|---------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Neutral** | Silence, pauses | Closed mouth for silence | (quiet moments) |
| **M** | M, P, B | Lips pressed together | **M**ama, **P**apa, **B**aby |
| **S** | S, Z, TH | Tongue against teeth | **S**un, **Z**oo, **Th**ink |
| **D** | D, T, N, L | Tongue to roof of mouth | **D**og, **T**op, **N**ew |
| **Ee** | EE, I, Y | Wide smile shape | S**ee**, **I**t, **Y**es |
| **Aa** | AA, A, AH | Open mouth for vowels | C**a**t, **A**pple, **Ah** |
| **Uh** | UH, U, ER | Neutral open mouth | B**u**t, **U**p, H**er** |
| **Oh** | OH, O, AW | Rounded lips | G**o**, **O**pen, **Aw**e |
| **R** | R | Pursed lips for R sound | **R**ed, Ca**r** |
| **W-Oo** | W, OO, QU | Very rounded lips | **W**ater, B**oo**k, **Qu**een |
| **F** | F, V | Lower lip to upper teeth | **F**ish, **V**ery |
| **L** | L | Tongue visible | **L**ove, Fe**l**l |
| **Smile** | Smile, happy | Happy expression | (emotional expressions) |
| **Surprised** | Surprised, shock | Wide open mouth | (exclamations, gasps) |

#### File Naming Requirements

Name your SVG or PNG files exactly as the shape names above:
- ‚úÖ `Neutral.svg`, `M.svg`, `S.svg`, `D.svg`, etc.
- ‚úÖ `neutral.png`, `m.png`, `s.png`, `d.png`, etc. (case-insensitive)
- ‚úÖ `mouth_Neutral.svg`, `shape_M.svg`, etc. (with prefixes)
- ‚ùå `mouth_01.svg`, `shape_A.svg`, `random_name.svg` (won't be recognized)

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Audio Quality**: Use clear audio with minimal background noise for optimal feature extraction
2. **Phoneme Accuracy**: Create distinct differences between each phoneme mouth shape
3. **Complete Set**: Upload all 14 required phoneme shapes for maximum accuracy and feature utilization
4. **File Naming**: Name files exactly as shown in the phoneme table above
5. **Sensitivity**: Start with default settings and adjust based on your audio characteristics
6. **Smoothing**: Use moderate smoothing (2-3) for natural movement without losing accuracy
7. **Frame Rate**: 24 FPS provides good balance of quality and file size
8. **Mapping Mode**: Use "Phoneme-based" for deterministic, feature-driven mouth shape mapping
9. **Library Management**: Save your phoneme sets to avoid re-uploading
10. **Quality Check**: Preview the animation before exporting to verify accurate phoneme mapping
11. **Audio Characteristics**: The system now uses advanced acoustic analysis - clearer speech will result in more accurate mouth shapes
12. **Deterministic Results**: The same audio file will always produce the same mouth shape sequence (no randomness)


## API Integration

The application now includes a complete REST API for programmatic access:

### Quick Start with API

1. **Start the API server:**
```bash
cd api
npm install
npm start
```

2. **Use the API client:**
```javascript
const client = new LipSyncAPIClient('http://localhost:3001/api');

const job = await client.generateAnimation(audioFile, imageFiles, {
    fps: 24,
    sensitivity: 1.2,
    backgroundColor: '#000000',
    format: 'video'
});

const result = await client.waitForCompletion(job.jobId);
await client.downloadFile(job.jobId);
```

For complete API documentation, see [api/README.md](api/README.md).

**Note:** The web application includes advanced intelligent expression mapping optimized for expressive mouth shape sets. The API server currently uses simplified mapping for demonstration purposes. For best results with expressive sets like smirks and grins, use the web application directly.

## Future Features

- MP4 export format (currently exports as WebM)
- Advanced mouth shape detection using AI
- Batch processing for multiple audio files
- Custom timing adjustments
- Integration with popular animation software
- Real-time lip-sync preview during audio playback
- API server integration of intelligent expression mapping
- Custom expression category definitions

## Troubleshooting

**Animation doesn't sync well:**
- Ensure you have uploaded all 14 required phoneme shapes
- Try the "Phoneme-based" mapping mode for standardized mouth shapes
- Adjust audio sensitivity and smoothing settings
- Check that mouth shapes are named correctly (see phoneme table)
- For traditional open/closed sequences, use "Volume-based" mapping

**Phoneme shapes not recognized:**
- Check file naming matches exactly: Neutral, M, S, D, Ee, Aa, Uh, Oh, R, W-Oo, F, L, Smile, Surprised
- Use SVG or PNG format only
- Ensure files aren't corrupted
- Try adding prefixes like "mouth_Neutral.svg" if needed

**Browser performance issues:**
- Use shorter audio files for testing
- Close other browser tabs
- Try a lower frame rate (12 or 24 FPS)

**Files won't upload:**
- Check file formats (PNG for images, common audio formats)
- Ensure files aren't corrupted
- Try refreshing the page
